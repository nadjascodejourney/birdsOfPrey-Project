    "mainText": [
      "Falconry is the art of training birds of prey, such as falcons, hawks, and eagles, to hunt wild game. This practice, which dates back to preliterate times, has evolved from a means of survival to a sport and a method for managing pests. Today, falconry is practiced worldwide, with strongholds in Britain, the United States, Central Asia, and several Persian Gulf states, among others.",
      "The birds used in falconry are divided into three groups based on their hunting habits and environments: longwings, shortwings, and broadwings. Each group has its unique traits and is adapted to different types of prey and terrain. Longwings, such as peregrines and sakers, are skilled in hunting other birds in flight, making them ideal for open landscapes. Shortwings, like goshawks and sparrowhawks, excel in taking ground game and are often used in wooded areas. Broadwings, including eagles and buzzards, are best suited for hunting in rolling countryside and mountainous terrain.",
      "Falconry has a rich history, with its roots tracing back to the Hittites and cave paintings from prehistoric sites. Over the centuries, it has flourished and declined, only to be revived in the 20th century as a humane and legal method for managing nuisance birds.",
      "Falconry plays a significant role in Mongolia, particularly in the steppes and among the local communities. This ancient practice has deep historical roots, dating back to the time of the Mongol Empire, and has been passed down through generations. Falconry is not only a sport but also a cultural symbol of Mongolia, with the falcon being reclaimed as the National Bird in 2012. This recognition highlights the importance of falconry in the country's heritage and identity."

This festival depicts the enduring tradition of falconry in Mongolia, where eagle masters and hunters display their skills and knowledge. ItÂ´s a celebration of the past and present of traditional hunting, offering an invaluable glimpse into the culture and history of Mongolia.",
        "Falconry in Mongolia is also recognized as a UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage, reflecting its significance in the country's cultural heritage. The practice involves keeping and training falcons to hunt in their natural state, a tradition that has been practiced for over 4000 years. The Khuraldai Naadam, a falcon-related festival, was established to re-awaken and promote this fascinating aspect of traditional Mongolian hunting culture. This festival includes a wide range of activities, including competitions among falcon trainers, horseback archery, and cultural performances, showcasing the richness and diversity of Mongolian traditions."
