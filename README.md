# Birds of Prey Website Project

This is a personal project repository for a website dedicated to birds of prey. 
This project is currently under development and is being built as a side project alongside my studies. 
Here you'll find all the details about the project's progress, technologies used, and future plans.

## Project Overview
This website aims to be a comprehensive resource for information about birds of prey. It will feature blog articles, detailed bird portraits, and a listing of upcoming events related to birds of prey in Germany. Users will be able to search for events based on their location.
