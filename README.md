Some of the future additions include:

- Building an API: [backendproject-birdsofprey](https://github.com/nadjascodejourney/backendproject-birdsofprey-api)
- User accounts and profiles
- Interactive maps for event locations
- Enhanced search and filter options for bird portraits and articles
- Integration with external bird-watching databases and resources
